# BLUEMOON PUT PUT GLORIFY
A nice little game for three persons, a few smartphones and a bigger screen.

## SETUP
You will need [__Node.js__](https://nodejs.org/en/) (npm) to run the server. Clone the repo, switch to the project directory and run

```
npm install
```

Then in the root directory run the server with

```
npm run server
```

Go to [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004) in the browser to run the viewer!

## CONNECT A CLIENT
Either you can add a controller directly in the viewer by clicking "Join", or you can go to [http://localhost:3004/controller](http://localhost:3004/controller) in the browser.

You can also connect from an external device by changing _localhost_ to the ip-adress of the computer. On windows the QR-code/client adress in the viewer will unfortunately not work :(

# HAPPY PUTTING!
